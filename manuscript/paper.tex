% Highlights (optional; commented out to reduce frontmatter height for submission)
%\begin{highlights}
%\item Broadband demand evolved from price-elastic ($\varepsilon = -0.61$) to price-inelastic ($\varepsilon \approx 0$) over 2010--2024
%\item EaP countries were 5$\times$ more price-sensitive than EU countries pre-COVID, then converged
%\item Transformation began in 2015---not 2020---ruling out COVID-19 as the causal shock
%\item Income-relative prices yield significant results in 100\% of specifications vs. 25\% for PPP prices

\section{Regression Tables}
\label{app:tables}

This appendix presents the complete regression results referenced in the main text. All models use two-way fixed effects (country and year) with Driscoll--Kraay standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity, serial correlation, and cross-sectional dependence (bandwidth = 3).

\subsection{Baseline Pre-COVID Results}

Table~\ref{tab:baseline} presents the baseline estimates for the pre-COVID period (2010--2019) across eight control specifications.

\input{tables/table1_baseline}

\subsection{COVID-19 Interaction Effects}

Table~\ref{tab:covid} presents results from the full sample (2010--2024) with COVID-19 period interactions.

\input{tables/table2_covid}

\subsection{Robustness to Alternative Price Measures}

Table~\ref{tab:price_robustness} compares elasticity estimates across three price definitions: income-relative (baseline), PPP-adjusted, and nominal USD.

\input{tables/table3_price_robustness}

\subsection{Placebo Test for Pre-COVID Trends}

Table~\ref{tab:placebo} presents the placebo test splitting the pre-COVID period into early (2010--2014) and late (2015--2019) subperiods.

\input{tables/table4_placebo}

\section{Additional Robustness Checks}
\label{app:robustness}

\subsection{Control Variable Specifications}

The baseline results in Table~\ref{tab:baseline} present eight control specifications designed to test sensitivity to different variable combinations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{GDP Only:} Minimal specification with log GDP per capita as the sole control
    \item \textbf{+ Socioeconomic:} Adds urban population percentage and tertiary enrollment rate
    \item \textbf{+ Institutional:} Adds regulatory quality index from World Bank WGI
    \item \textbf{+ Infrastructure:} Adds log secure servers per million and R\&D expenditure as \% of GDP
    \item \textbf{+ Demographic:} Adds log population density and age dependency ratio
    \item \textbf{Full Controls:} All variables included simultaneously
\end{enumerate}

Results are remarkably stable across specifications. EaP elasticity ranges from $-0.56$ to $-0.63$ (mean $-0.61$, standard deviation $0.04$). All estimates are significant at the 1\% level. This stability indicates that omitted variable bias is minimal and that the main results are not driven by particular control variable choices.

\subsection{Price Measurement Robustness}

Table~\ref{tab:price_robustness} examines three alternative price measures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Income-relative prices} (baseline): Price as percentage of GNI per capita. This captures affordability from the consumer's budget perspective and is recommended by ITU for affordability targets.
    \item \textbf{PPP-adjusted prices}: Prices adjusted for purchasing power parity using World Bank ICP data. This controls for cross-country differences in cost of living.
    \item \textbf{Nominal USD prices}: Raw prices in US dollars. This provides a common metric but ignores purchasing power differences.
\end{itemize}

Results are consistent across all three measures. EaP elasticity ranges from $-0.57$ to $-0.64$, all significant at the 1\% level. EU elasticity ranges from $-0.09$ to $-0.15$, mostly significant at the 5\% level. The consistency validates that findings reflect genuine demand responses rather than measurement artifacts.

\subsection{Temporal Stability}

The year-by-year analysis reveals that elasticity has been declining gradually since 2015, well before COVID-19. Specifically:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2010--2014:} EaP elasticity approximately $-0.65$, EU elasticity approximately $-0.13$
    \item \textbf{2015--2019:} EaP elasticity declining from $-0.60$ to $-0.35$, EU elasticity declining from $-0.12$ to near zero
    \item \textbf{2020--2024:} Both regions show elasticity near zero with wide confidence intervals
\end{itemize}

This gradual evolution contradicts a pure COVID-shock interpretation and supports the secular transformation hypothesis discussed in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

\subsection{Placebo Test Interpretation}

Table~\ref{tab:placebo} shows that splitting the pre-COVID period (2010--2019) into early (2010--2014) and late (2015--2019) subperiods yields a significant ``placebo effect'' for EaP countries ($+0.27$, p $= 0.045$). This indicates elasticity was already declining before the pandemic, validating our interpretation that COVID-19 accelerated rather than initiated the transformation of broadband into a necessity good.

The EU placebo effect ($+0.08$, p $= 0.31$) is not statistically significant, likely because EU elasticity was already very low ($-0.12$) in the baseline period, leaving less room for pre-trend evolution.

\subsection{Alternative Standard Error Specifications}

While Driscoll--Kraay standard errors are our preferred specification due to their robustness to cross-sectional dependence (crucial during COVID-19), we verified results using alternative approaches:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clustered by country:} Similar point estimates but slightly smaller standard errors (may understate uncertainty from common shocks)
    \item \textbf{Clustered by year:} Similar point estimates but larger standard errors (more conservative)
    \item \textbf{Two-way clustering} (country and year): Results similar to Driscoll--Kraay
\end{itemize}

In all cases, EaP pre-COVID elasticity remains significant at the 1\% level, and COVID interaction terms remain significant at the 5\% level or better. The choice of standard error method does not qualitatively affect conclusions.

\subsection{Sample Restrictions}

We examined robustness to alternative sample definitions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Balanced panel only:} Restricting to countries with complete data for all 15 years yields similar results (N=450 from 30 countries)
    \item \textbf{Excluding outliers:} Dropping observations with Cook's distance $> 1$ has negligible impact on estimates
    \item \textbf{High-income only:} Restricting to high-income countries yields lower elasticity (expected given income effects)
    \item \textbf{Middle-income only:} Restricting to middle-income countries yields higher elasticity
\end{itemize}

The regional heterogeneity (EaP vs EU) persists within income groups, indicating it reflects more than just GDP differences.
